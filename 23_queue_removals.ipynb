    "# Queue Removals\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a list of n integers arr, which represent elements in a queue (in order from front to back). You're also given an integer x, and must perform x iterations of the following 3-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pop x elements from the front of queue (or, if it contains fewer than x elements, pop all of them)\n",
    "- Of the elements that were popped, find the one with the largest value (if there are multiple such elements, take the one which had been popped the earliest), and remove it\n",
    "- For each one of the remaining elements that were popped (in the order they had been popped), decrement its value by 1 if it's positive (otherwise, if its value is 0, then it's left unchanged), and then add it back to the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute a list of x integers output, the ith of which is the 1-based index in the original array of the element which had been removed in step 2 during the ith iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "`int[] findPositions(int[] arr, int x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "x is in the range [1, 316].\n",
    "n is in the range [x, x*x].\n",
    "Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, x].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a list of x integers output, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 6\n",
    "arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "output = [5, 6, 4, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial queue is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5] (from front to back).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first iteration, the first 5 elements are popped off the queue, leaving just [5]. Of the popped elements, the largest one is the 4, which was at index 5 in the original array. The remaining elements are then decremented and added back onto the queue, whose contents are then [5, 0, 1, 1, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second iteration, all 5 elements are popped off the queue. The largest one is the 5, which was at index 6 in the original array. The remaining elements are then decremented (aside from the 0) and added back onto the queue, whose contents are then [0, 0, 0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third iteration, all 4 elements are popped off the queue. The largest one is the 1, which had the initial value of 3 at index 4 in the original array. The remaining elements are added back onto the queue, whose contents are then [0, 0, 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fourth iteration, all 3 elements are popped off the queue. Since they all have an equal value, we remove the one that was popped first, which had the initial value of 1 at index 1 in the original array. The remaining elements are added back onto the queue, whose contents are then [0, 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final iteration, both elements are popped off the queue. We remove the one that was popped first, which had the initial value of 2 at index 2 in the original array."
