    "\n",
    "We consider two brackets to be matching if the first bracket is an open-bracket, e.g., (, {, or [, and the second bracket is a close-bracket of the same type. That means ( and ), [ and ], and { and } are the only pairs of matching brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a sequence of brackets is said to be balanced if the following conditions are met:\n",
    "- The sequence is empty, or\n",
    "- The sequence is composed of two or more non-empty sequences, all of which are balanced, or\n",
    "- The first and last brackets of the sequence are matching, and the portion of the sequence without the first and last elements is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string of brackets. Your task is to determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return true, otherwise, return false\n",
