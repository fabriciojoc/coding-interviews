    "It takes you 1 minute to eat all of the pieces of candy in a bag (irrespective of how many pieces of candy are inside), and as soon as you finish, the bag mysteriously refills. If there were x pieces of candy in the bag at the beginning of the minute, then after you've finished you'll find that floor(x/2) pieces are now inside.\n",
